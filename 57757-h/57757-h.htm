<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,—</p>

<p>Indignation at my dedicating this book to you will be
useless, since I am at present three thousand miles out of
your reach. Moreover, this dedication is not intended as
a public monument to our friendship;—I know too much
for that. If that were the case, we should manage to
quarrel even at this distance, I am quite confident, before
the proof-sheets had left the press. But I can dedicate it
to you alone of all my college friends, because you and I
were brought so especially into the atmosphere of the man
who inspired me to undertake it,—the man to whom, under
God, I shall owe most of what grace and culture I may ever
acquire. You and I know his wonderful unselfishness, his
tender sympathy, his exquisite delicacy of thought and life,
as well as others know his wit and his scholarship. It was
while I was writing the opening pages of this story that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
news of his death came. It was while my work was but
half finished, that I was called away to the most remote
and wildest portions of this great country of ours, and thus
has my story become a sketch,—a bare outline of what
I intended.</p>

<p>But, such as it is, you and a few others will know what
I mean by it; and that point gained, the rest matters little.
If by it one single heart is made to throb, even for an
instant, with love of this country, of which we can never
be too mindful nor too proud, my object will be gained.
And now I commend to you this book.</p>

<p class="noic">Ever your friend,</p>

<small>THE LECTURE ON DOMESTIC ARTS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>It was quarter after two in the afternoon,
and the Professor was sitting at his
desk, engaged in arranging the notes of
his lecture, when there came a knock on
the door.</p>

<p>“Come in,” said the Professor. “Ah,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Ned! is it you?” This to a graceful boy
of twenty, who entered the room.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is Ned,” said the boy; “and he
particularly wishes to see you for a few
minutes.”</p>

<p>“Every moment is precious,” said the
Professor, “until my lecture is in order.
What is the matter? Are you in
trouble?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Ned, “I am in trouble.”</p>

<p>“Then let me read to you,” said the
Professor, “the concluding paragraph of
my lecture on Domestic Arts.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t!” said Ned; “I really am
in trouble.”</p>

<p>“Are you the insulter or the insulted,
this time?” asked the Professor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>“Neither,” said Ned, shortly; “and I’m
not in trouble on my own account.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the Professor; “then you
have got into some difficulty in your explorations
in low life; or you have spent
more than your income; or it’s the perpetual
Tom.”</p>

<p>“It’s the perpetual Tom,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“I supposed so,” observed the Professor.
“What has that youth been doing
now? Drinking, swearing, gambling, bad
company, theft, murder?—out with it!
I am prepared for anything, from the expression
of your face; for anything, that
is to say, except my lecture on Domestic
Arts, which comes at three.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you choose to make fun of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
me,” said Ned, “I can go; but I thought
you would advise me.”</p>

<p>“And so I will, you ridiculous creature,
when you need it,” said the Professor;
“only at such times you generally act for
yourself. But, come; my advice and sympathy
are yours; so what has Tom done?”</p>

<p>“He has fallen in love,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” said the Professor.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” repeated Ned, more firmly,
“he has fallen in love.”</p>

<p>“’Tis the way of all flesh,” said the
Professor; “but I don’t think Tom can
fall in love. He never even dislikes any
one without a cause.”</p>

<p>“That’s all very well, sir,” said Ned;
“but when a fellow has a girl’s picture, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
looks at it when he thinks he isn’t
watched; and when he receives notes, and
keeps them, instead of throwing them
around, as usual; and when he takes to
being blue,—what do you say?”</p>

<p>“Please state your propositions separately,”
said the Professor, “and I will endeavor
to form an opinion. When a
fellow has a girl’s picture,—what was the
rest?”</p>

<p>“I wish you wouldn’t make fun of me,”
said Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, in Heaven’s name, what is there
to trouble you, if Tom is in love?” asked
the Professor.</p>

<p>“Because he hasn’t told me,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh! you are jealous then,” rejoined the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Professor. “You are the most selfish person,
for one who is so generous, that I have
ever seen. You are morbid upon the subject
of Tom, I believe.”</p>

<p>“Well, look here,” said Ned; “I have
neither father nor mother; I have no one
except Tom. I care more for him than for
any one else in the world, as you know;
but you never will know how much I care
for him; and it does seem hard that he
should shut me out of his confidence when
I have done nothing to forfeit it. There’s
some girl at the bottom of all this. He
and that big Western friend of his, the
Blush Rose, whom I never liked, have
been off together two or three times; and,
as I say, Tom has got this picture; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the Blush Rose knows it, and knows who
she is. I’ve seen them looking at it, and
admiring it. I’m afraid, from Tom’s not
telling me about it, that he’s doing something
out of the way.”</p>

<p>“In that case,” said the Professor, “you
had better let me read you the closing paragraph
of my lecture on Domestic Arts.”</p>

<p>“No, I thank you,” said Ned; “I shall
have to hear it, any way, this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“So you will,” said the Professor; “and,
by the way, I shall give you a private if
you behave to-day as you did in my last
lecture. I have told your class-tutor to
warn you.”</p>

<p>“Well, that is pleasant,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“I meant it to be,” replied the Professor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
“Good-by. I may call at your room to-night,—to
see Tom.”</p>

<p>And, as Ned was heard going down the
stairs, the Professor, seeing that he had
still twenty-five minutes to spare, took
his lecture, and sat down before the fire,
which flickered slightly, and just served
to destroy the dampness of that April day.</p>

<small>THE PICTURE OVER THE FIREPLACE.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Whether the Professor would have
made any alterations or amendments in
his lecture, it is difficult to say; that he did
not is due to the fact that his eye fell upon
a little photograph, which hung over his
fireplace. As he sits there, thinking over
what Ned has told him, and laughing at
the idea of Tom’s being really in love, he
gazes on this little photograph, and smiles.
The Professor has one or two real art treasures,
but nothing that he values quite as
much as this fading picture. This is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
only copy in existence; and this hangs
there, and will hang there until the Professor
dies. How well he remembers the
morning when the two boys, whom he
loves so well, rushed into his room, and
left it there! As he looks at it now, there
is an expression of tenderness on his plain
but strongly cut features that would greatly
astonish those of his pupils who only
know him as a crusty instructor.</p>

<p>The Professor is somewhat crusty, it must
be owned. It is, however, an acquired and
not a natural crustiness. Cause, the fact
that at thirty years of age he discovered
that he cared more for a certain Miss Spencer
than for all the world beside. On intimating
this fact to her, she told him that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
she should always value his friendship;
and that she hoped soon to introduce to
him her cousin Hugh, “who is,” she added
quietly, “to become my husband.” After
this the Professor withdrew almost entirely
from society, and plunged deeper
and deeper into study. Before many
years his reputation was cosmopolitan,
his head bald, and his life a matter of
routine. Boys came and went; and at
intervals he repeated before them much
of what he knew. It is to these two boys,
of whom he thinks now, as he gazes on the
picture over the mantel, that he owes his
rescue from this lethargic life.</p>

<p>What does he see in the picture? He
sees behind a chair, in which a boy is sitting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
another boy with soft, curling brown
hair, deep blue eyes, and dazzling complexion.
His features are delicately cut;
but the especial beauty of his face is the
brilliancy of color in his hair, eyes, and
complexion. There is the freshness of
youth on his features; and his whole attitude,
as he leans over his companion, is
full of that quaint grace of boyish tenderness
so indefinable and so transitory. The
boy in the chair has a face full of strength
and weakness. The photograph makes
him appear the more striking of the two,
though the less handsome. The sunny
sweetness of the first face, though it
never alters, never becomes wearisome;
but the second face is now all love, now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
disfigured by scorn and hatred, now full of
intellect, and glowing with animation, now
sullen and morose. The complexion is
olive, the eyes brown, the lips strongly cut,
yet so mobile as to be capable of every
variety of earnest and sneering expression.
The face is always, in all its varying phases,
the face of one who is not dissatisfied
but unsatisfied. This is what the Professor
sees, as the firelight throws its glimmer
over the room, making grotesque shadows
waver fitfully on the pictures and books
around him, as well as on the heavy curtains
that hide the rays of afternoon light
which struggle through the leafy boughs
of the old elms in the yard without.</p>

<p>As the Professor sits there thinking, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
seems to recall again the first visit of Tom
and Ned to his room. Tom is a lovely
boy,—the original of the standing figure
in the photograph; and the Professor
had been attracted by his face once or
twice when he had met him in the yard,
soon after his entrance into college. Still
he is surprised, one evening, when he
hears a knock at his door, and this Freshman
enters half shyly. The Professor asks
him to be seated, and then looks at him
inquiringly.</p>

<p>“I was awfully homesick,” says Tom,
with perfect trustfulness; “and mother
told me that you were once a very dear
friend of hers; so I thought I would come
up and see you.” The Professor is bewildered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Still he is a gentleman; so he
smiles, and says to Tom:—</p>

<p>“Pray be seated. Your mother is well,
I trust.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” says Tom. “Perhaps, as
she hasn’t seen you since before I was
born, I ought to have said who she was.
Her name was Spencer.”</p>

<p>The Professor turns quickly. Tom proceeds
with entire unconsciousness:—</p>

<p>“She often speaks of you, sir, and always
in a way that has made me want to
know you.”</p>

<p>“I am very glad, Tom,” said the Professor.
“You must excuse my calling you
by your first name; but then you are the
son of—your mother.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>Any one but Tom, who never noticed
anything, would have seen here that the
Professor’s manner was peculiar. But
Tom is always so brightly ignorant of
what is before his eyes, that the Professor
recovers his self-possession, and says
calmly:—</p>

<p>“And your mother is well, I hope?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” said Tom; “very well, but
a little sad at my leaving home. She is
very fond of me, sir.”</p>

<p>“Strange fact!” said the Professor,
dryly. “And I see that you are equally
fond of her. I am not given to moralizing;
but I think that college life will not
decay you, if you don’t forget how much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
you are to your mother,—how unhappy
you can make her.”</p>

<p>“Forget her?” said Tom; “not I!
When I am at home, I make love to her
all the time.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said the Professor, “it is well
that you have left home; for it will soon
be time for you to make love to some one
else.”</p>

<p>As the Professor makes this observation,
there is another knock at the door,
and Ned enters. Who is Ned? Ned is
the original of the sitting figure in the
little picture over the fireplace. He is
despotic in character, and has therefore
many sincere friends and enemies. He
is fearless when indignant, and is indignant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
easily. He is not handsome as Tom
is,—for Tom’s beauty charms you immediately,
and the charm is never broken;
but he has a curious grace and fascination
of manner when he is not perverse;
but then, he often is perverse.</p>

<p>The Professor cannot tell whether he
likes Ned, or not. He has been giving
Ned private tuition, to fit him for college,
for nearly a year. All their acquaintance
hitherto has been one of business, all
their conversation confined to an occasional
dry remark on either side. Now,
when their contract is fulfilled, the Professor
cannot imagine why Ned should
take advantage of his general invitation,
and visit him. Still he asks Ned to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
seated, and then enters into conversation
with him.</p>

<p>Ned talks. His keen eye has noted
everything ludicrous and everything interesting
among his instructors, among
his classmates, among all the persons
and things with which college life has
brought him in contact. He is full of
animation; he tells stories, all of which
have a point; he sparkles with wit, which
is none the less brilliant for having a
certain boyish freshness about it. All
this is a new revelation to the Professor.
He laughs, and in his turn becomes entertaining;
and, finally, going to his
sideboard, produces three quaint glasses,
which he fills with some of that rare and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
wonderful old Madeira, which many of
his acquaintances have heard of, but
which few have ever seen.</p>

<p>Tom, in the mean time, sits listening,
radiant with enjoyment, with the firelight
tinting his lovely face. “Such a jolly
old fellow as this Professor is!” he says
to himself; “and such a being as Ned!”
He is happier than he has been since he
left home; and he wishes his mother
could look in upon them now; and he
drains his glass to her health. He is
puzzled because Ned will address his
remarks only to the Professor, and seems
shy whenever he speaks. Finally, conscious
that it is growing late, he bids the
Professor farewell, and Ned rises to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
accompany him. The Professor says
then, with a courteous and quiet dignity:—</p>

<p>“Tom, you must give my regards to
your mother, when you write. Tell her
that her boy will be always an object of
especial interest to her old friend.” Then,
turning to Ned, the Professor adds, as
Tom disappears in the entry:—</p>

<p>“I have to thank you for a very
pleasant evening. You will come again,
my boy, will you not? Why have you
never before shown me what you really
are?”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t for you, sir,” said Ned, with
a certain frankness that was not discourteous.
“It was for Tom, sir; though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
I like you, and hope we shall be friends.
But the moment I saw Tom, I felt drawn
towards him; and, as I saw him come
up here, I felt that here was a chance to
get acquainted with him. Good-night,
sir.”</p>

<p>And Ned joined Tom at the foot of
the stairs, leaving the Professor in a state
of complete bewilderment. The Professor
laughs now, as he recalls that evening,
and looks again at the picture over the
fireplace.</p>

<p>“They are an interesting pair,—a
sunbeam and a volcano,” he says; and,
throwing on his cloak, just as the bell
begins to ring, he starts for his lecture-room.</p>

<h2><a name="III" id="III">III.</a><br />
<small>HE MOVED WITH A VAST CROWD.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>It was just after supper; and the
Professor, with his thoughts still occupied
by Tom and Ned, walked slowly
toward his room through the dimly-lighted
yard, where the twilight was
half dispelled by the gleams of gas-light
that stole from the windows around. He
sauntered along, enjoying the sweet
spring air of the evening, and touching
his hat to one boy after another until he
came by Ned’s entry, when he turned,
and took his way to the room of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
boys. He had stopped, as he passed
through the square, for his paper, and
had noticed that a crowd seemed to be
eagerly and excitedly discussing the news
of the evening around the post-office.
Pausing an instant in the entry to look
at his paper, before ascending the stairs,
his eye fell on an announcement which
caused him to utter an exclamation of
surprise; and he rushed eagerly into the
room, with the words:—</p>

<p>“Boys, have you heard the news?”</p>

<p>Ned turned from the glass, where he
was tying his cravat, and Tom raised
himself from his lounge; but before either
of them had an opportunity to answer,
the Professor said:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>“There has been a quarrel here. Now,
boys, I must know all about it. See, I’m
going to spring the lock, and have you
clear your minds at once.”</p>

<p>“There’s nothing to clear,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“Speak for yourself, if you please,”
said the Professor. “You may not have
a mind at all; but I know that Ned has,
to a limited extent. Doubtless you are
both wrong; so let me see which will be
gentleman enough to apologize first.
Come, boys, this matter must be set
right. ‘Let not the sun go down upon
your wrath’ is one of the best pieces of
advice ever given.”</p>

<p>“It is after sunset now,” said Ned;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
“and we are not both wrong. I am
right.”</p>

<p>“Cheerful self-confidence,” said the
Professor. “Please let me understand
the cause of wrath.”</p>

<p>“Simply because I object to the Blush
Rose,” said Ned. “I say that he has
come between us.”</p>

<p>“And I say”—broke in Tom.</p>

<p>“Hush, Tom!” said the Professor,
“until Ned has finished.”</p>

<p>“I have nothing more to say,” said
Ned, “except that Tom must, once for
all, choose between us.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Tom; “as you please;
only, while I don’t care for any fellow as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
do for you, I’m not going to submit to
dictation.”</p>

<p>“You’re entangled with some woman,
through Blodgett,” said Ned. “He’s a
nice associate for a gentleman, he is.”</p>

<p>“I entangled with a woman!” repeated
Tom. “Why, Ned! you’re crazy.”</p>

<p>“Whose picture is it that you are carrying?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, thunder!” said Tom; “is that
what all this row is about?”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’ve fallen in love, and in
Junior year too!” continued Ned, wrathfully
and contemptuously.</p>

<p>“Juniors have done such things before,”
observed the Professor.</p>

<p>“Fallen in love!” said Tom; “as if I’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
do that! Look here, old fellow, if you
knew about that picture, you’d ask my
pardon.”</p>

<p>“Well, as I don’t, I shan’t,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“Come, boys,” said the Professor, “this
ridiculous quarrel, worthy only of a couple
of little children, has gone quite far
enough. Ned, I think you are petulant
and absurd; but if you will go out for
a few minutes, and take a short walk,
Tom will unbosom himself to me, I am
sure.”</p>

<p>“Well, I call that cheek, to turn a man
out of his own room,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“Correct that sentence, please, Ned,”
said the Professor. “You would call it
cheek if it were not done by a member<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of the Faculty. There, be off with you.
And now, Tom, tell your story.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t any,” said Tom; “only Ned
is in one of his moods.”</p>

<p>“Then you are not in love,” said the
Professor.</p>

<p>“Why, no!” said Tom, “how could I
be?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied the Professor;
“but people are sometimes. And have
you a secret connected with that fat,
red-faced brute, Blodgett, whom you call
the Blush Rose?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes,” said Tom: “it’s about a
photograph.”</p>

<p>“Let us see this photograph,” said the
Professor. “Explain!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, it’s a surprise for Ned, don’t
you see?” said Tom. “It’s the proof
picture of me in the last theatricals. See,
there I am as Marton, the Pride of the
Market.”</p>

<p>“What a mistake nature made about
your sex, Tom!” said the Professor.
“You dear little peasant girl, put yourself
away directly; and now take my
advice: show it to Ned; it will make
him ashamed of his folly, and will prevent
any further angry words between
you. It is hard to quarrel, and so you
will think some day, though now you find
it so easy. There, put it away; for I
hear Ned’s footsteps on the stairs! Come
in, Ned! Why! what has happened?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>For Ned, standing in the open door-way,
his perverse moodiness all gone,
wore an expression the Professor had
never seen before.</p>

<p>“Happened!” said Ned. “Something to
live for, something to die for. We know
now that we have a country. Haven’t
you heard the news?”</p>

<p>“Dear me!” said the Professor, “that’s
what I came to tell you; but your quarrel
drove it out of my head.”</p>

<p>“How could anything else come into
your head?” said Ned.</p>

<p>“Tell me what it is,” asked Tom, impatiently.</p>

<p>“The President has called the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
to arms, to aid him in saving the country,”
said Ned, fairly glowing as he spoke.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Professor, “is it not
grand to think that we are aroused at
last?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Ned, “I have still more
to tell you. I have enlisted.”</p>

<p>There was a pause of a few moments;
then the Professor grasped Ned’s hand,
and said simply:—</p>

<p>“My noble boy!”</p>

<p>“What do you say, Tom?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“I’m going with you, old fellow,” said
Tom; and he threw his arm over Ned’s
shoulder, and smiled at the Professor.</p>

<h2><a name="IV" id="IV">IV.</a><br />
<small>NED’S NOTE-BOOK.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>It is well that I formed the habit of
keeping a note-book some time ago. How
interesting what I am now writing will be
to my wife and children in years to come,
when I sit before my own fire, in my own
house! The college chronicle of funny
adventures and curious stories that my
note-book has previously contained is suspended
for a time; and I am thinking of
matters of life and death now. Well, it
is splendid to have a life to lose; and the
thought of death, in this cause, has a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
grand, awful thrill in it, that drives away
all the former terror death has possessed
for me. These remarks are intended as
an opening of my war note-book. Here
am I, just twenty-one, and a captain,—a
whole captain. It is absurd; no, it isn’t.
Col. Burke is raising a regiment. He has
as much superfluity about him as an iron
nail has, and no more. He was introduced
to me about a week ago, and was told
about my visits to the people around
Crescent Court. People will make me
out a philanthropist, which I am not; for
I despise most people I know, though the
lower classes are quite interesting, but
dirty. I never talked religion to any of
those creatures in my life. I have given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
them very little in charity; but I have
listened to what they say as I would to
my own classmates; and, having talked
with them at the North End, I have
bowed to them at the West End. In a
word, I have carried <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les convenances</i> into
Richmond Street, and have not electioneered.
Result, I have some influence,
which is useless, except in keeping me
clear of pickpockets. So the colonel
would have me raise a company. I
laughed at the idea, but consented to
try; and here are over fifty recruits
already. I told them that I had about
as much to learn as any of them, and
agreed to have the captain elected by
vote, myself becoming a private. I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
have been very much disgusted if they
had taken me at my word; but they
didn’t. So I am a captain; but my lieutenants
are still to be found.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Tom is full of patriotism. I never can
tell how deeply a sentiment enters his
mind; but he is fretting terribly about
going with me. How I wish he could!
but his father very sensibly advises him
to wait a year longer, till he is through
at Harvard; and his mother is in great
distress at the idea of his leaving her.
The Professor is non-committal on the
subject.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This morning entered Jane Ellen Bingley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
to the recruiting office, where I was
receiving enlistments. Jane Ellen is limp
in appearance, but energetic in character.
Her bonnet was wine-colored velvet; her
shawl draggled green, with a habit of
falling off her shoulders as she talked;
and her gown was calico. By the bonnet
I recognized her. She is the chief attraction
at one of the North Street dance-houses,
and entertains an admiration for
me of which I am utterly undeserving.
I have so often declined in forcible language
to dance with her, that I did not
suppose she could feel pleasantly toward
me; but she came forward and said:—</p>

<p>“Here’s my man!”</p>

<p>Her man was a stout fellow, rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
stupid-looking, with a dyed mustache.
Jane Ellen herself is really very pretty,
and might possibly reform, if she was sent
away from here. Reformation, when possible,
is only possible through removal.
So Jane Ellen having presented her man,
I said briefly:—</p>

<p>“What of it?”</p>

<p>Thereupon Jane Ellen explained that
her man wished to enlist, and that she
wished him to come under me, as she
knew I’d be a good captain to the poor
boy. Sensible of the compliment, I suggested
to Jane Ellen the propriety of
marrying him first. In that way I explained
to her he would send her his
salary (I could not say wages, Jane Ellen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
being American); he would have some
object for working his way up from the
ranks; and he would have a home to think
of, when away, wounded, sick, or expecting
to die. All these things would benefit
him greatly. I regret to say that Michael
appeared more affected than Jane Ellen
at the pictures I drew. Jane Ellen’s answer,
which only came after considerable
reflection, was, to say the least, peculiar.</p>

<p>“I never expected to live to be a married
woman,” she remarked; “and it’s a
queer home I’d be able to make for anybody.
However, it may do Mike good;
so I’ll do it. So, Mike, I’ll marry you
right off, and endeavor to be a decent
woman,—until you come back from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
war again;” which last clause was prudently
added.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Another quarrel with Tom; and this
time the Professor admits that I am right.
Tom begs me to write, and solicit his
parents’ consent; and I won’t do it; so
Tom sulks,—that is the only word,—and
will not be appeased.</p>

<p>He even declares that I wish to get rid
of him, when it will almost break my heart
to go without him. If that boy only
knew what he was to me, who am without
father, mother, or family of my own, and
with almost no friends, except the Professor!
However, for the same reason
that I have never yet visited him at his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
house, because I did not wish to have our
attachment or my character analyzed or
criticised by his parents, I will not say a
word now. I believe it will do him good
to go; for I know the thought of going
has done me good.</p>

<p>The Professor has a plan, he says, and
wishes me to be at home to-night, so that
he can tell it to me.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Professor has told me a great deal
more than he has actually said. I know
now why he cares so much for Tom; and
I should like to see Tom’s mother. I
wonder if a woman will ever change my
life; and I wonder if I shall ever care for
any woman as much as I do for Tom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
The Professor says that Tom must go;
that he is fretting himself sick now, and
that it will develop his manliness of character.
He thinks I am right in not interfering,
however, and says that he is going
to try what he can do. Dear old fellow!
His face flushed, and he gave a curious
sort of gulp, as he said:—</p>

<p>“She always respected me; and I think
she would let Tom go, if I advised her
to do so.”</p>

<p>“Then shall you write to her?” I asked.</p>

<p>“No, Ned,” he said; “I shall go and
visit her, and start to-morrow. The first
time in twenty years,—dear me, the first
time in twenty years! How old I am
getting to be!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>I knew what he meant; and I honored
his pluck. I should sort of like to be in
love myself; but I am half afraid to think
about it. Oh, well! there will be plenty
of time when the war is over. The Professor
is to start to-morrow; and Tom is
not to know about it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>My first lieutenant is a treasure. His
name is Murphy; and he is a retired
rough, by profession, but he has splendid
stuff in him. Our acquaintance had a
peculiar beginning. I was drilling a
squad of men, and not succeeding very
well in what I was about, when this giant
loafed in, and began to make a disturbance.
I looked at him, and saw that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
remonstrance would be in vain; so I
knocked him down, seeing my opportunity
to do so effectively. My men laughed.
The giant raised himself in astonishment.</p>

<p>“You can’t do that again,” said he.
Another laugh from the chorus.</p>

<p>“I know it,” said I. Still another
laugh.</p>

<p>“I could just walk through you in two
minutes,” he growled, with an oath.</p>

<p>“I believe you,” said I; “and I shall
give you a chance to, if you don’t keep
quiet.”</p>

<p>He kept quiet for a time. Then, while
I was trying some manœuvre, he came
up and said, quite politely:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>“Perhaps I can help you.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said I; “do you know anything
about it?” Then Murphy informed
me that he had been in several places
where there had been fighting; and I saw
he was far my superior in many respects.
So, when I got him to enlist, and found
that he was thoroughly interested, and
that the men liked him with a feeling of
fellowship that they will never have for
me, I hope, I talked with the colonel about
making him my first lieutenant; and it is
now a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fait accompli</i>. Murphy’s delight
and gratitude at receiving his commission
knew no bounds; and several of his
cousins enlisted immediately. He has
now a sense of personal devotion to me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
that will help me greatly. Dear me, how
old and mature and self-reliant I am
growing! and, three weeks ago, I was
such a baby! Murphy is the second
largest and second strongest man of us
all. The largest is a large-eyed, half-crazy
clairvoyant, gentle as a dove, and
strong as an ox. I found him weeping
the other day; and, somewhat disgusted,
as well as astonished, asked the cause.
Result was, that he said he wept about me.
I was not to die in battle, nor in sickness,
but was to meet with a dishonorable
death for a dishonorable action. Tom and
Murphy were furious; but I couldn’t be before
the two or three men who heard it; so
I treated the affair as a good joke. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
boys call this fellow Mooney; which name
is appropriate certainly. Tom has been in
two or three times to drill. He studies Hardee
incessantly; practises by himself all
that he can, and would form himself into a
whole squad, and drill himself, if it were
possible. He is even getting into the
way of planning battles and movements,
and is perfectly wild at each report in
the newspapers. I never saw him in such
a state before, over anything. His lessons
must be suffering in consequence; and I
don’t dare to think of the number of times
he has cut prayers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Hurrah! I wish pencil and paper could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
yell with joy; and then a fearful noise
would issue from this note-book!</p>

<p>The Professor has sent me by telegraph
the announcement that Tom is to
go with me. It is brief; but I have read
it with delight a dozen times:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">All right! Please send him home
immediately!</span>”</p></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I know of nothing which has ever given
me more pleasure than those seven words.
Tom has gone off in the most remarkably
vague state of mind; and I am going to
see my colonel this evening, to find out
whether his youth (though, as he is not
quite two years younger than myself, perhaps
I should say our youth) will unfit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
him for the position of second lieutenant.
Any way, he’s going; and that’s enough
to make me happy for the rest of the
war. The only thing that troubles me
is Mooney’s prediction, which keeps ringing
in my ears. I am not to die in battle,
nor by sickness, but to receive a dishonorable
death for a dishonorable action. I
don’t care for the death so much; but I
do pray to God, that, while I am in my
country’s holy service at least, I may not
soil my soul. What a sentence! Well,
I’m safe in knowing that no one but
myself will ever see this note-book.</p>

<small>CORRESPONDENCE.</small></h2>
</div>


<h3>1.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Tom</span>:—This letter will reach
you after you have been at home a day;
and you must leave home as soon as you
receive it, to join my company. Our
colonel is splendid,—grim and grizzled,
and the nerve of a steam-engine. I told
him about you, and said I wanted you as
second lieutenant. He asked how much
you knew; and I said, “Little enough,
but more than any other of my vagabonds,—God
bless them!” Then I told him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
about your study of Hardee; and he
laughed, but asked me anxiously what
you thought of Hardee. I forget what
I said; but I know your opinion satisfied
him perfectly; for he said that your youth
was your greatest disqualification. Then
I said that the rough set of my company
needed the influence of an acknowledged
gentleman, as well as the fellow-feeling
and sympathy which that rough Murphy
gives them. He agreed to that. Then
he spoke of the value, in any rank of life,
of a university education;—he hasn’t
been through Harvard, you see;—and I
agree with him. Then, when he heard
who was your father, and who was your
mother, he smiled, and said he believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
in blood. I agreed again with him, and
expressed the opinion that no one could
get along very well without it. Moreover,
I said, that, if you did not come as an
officer, the whole company would become
insubordinate; for you always had your
own way with me; and it would not do
for a private to control his captain. He
laughed; but you are sure of your position,
if you come on at once. We are not a
swell regiment, Tom; but my sword-belt
and sash are stunning, for all that. You
must begin work at once. And, Tom,
you must feel an interest in Murphy. It
will do him good; and, through him, the
men. He dined with me to-day, and
made an attempt to eat with his fork instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
of his knife, which was tolerably
successful. He is a little uneasy about
meeting you, being sensible of a certain
lack of polish in his manner; but with you
as the positive pole, and I as the negative,
we shall have him duly magnetized in
time.</p>

<p>I have been out to Cambridge, to see
about destroying our old room; but I
could not do it. I sat down and cried
like a towel, or a sponge; I couldn’t help
it. The goody had profited by your
absence to leave everything out of order;
for which I thanked her in my soul.
The pictures that I hated, and the pictures
that you didn’t like, hung on the walls;
your dressing-gown was in your chair;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the globe in which our departed goldfish
once resided was still swinging at the
window; and everything seemed like a
dream of the past to me. Well, I should
have been a brute if I hadn’t felt a little
touched.</p>

<p>O Tom! you’ve forgotten to return
“Roderick Random” to the library; and
Sibley will come down on you for a nice
lot of fines, see if he don’t.</p>

<p>But I was going to tell you about our
room. Bob Lennox, who is rooming outside,
you know, wants to come in as
tenant during our absence, so that we can
have everything just as it always has
been, when we come back by next class-day;
by which time, I am quite sure, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
war will be ended; so I agreed to his
proposition, subject to your objection,
of course.</p>

<p>I thought, since your educational advantages
impressed the colonel, that a
copy of the last rank-list might work in
your favor; but I decided, finally, that it
would require too much explanation. In
the same way I was thinking of getting
you a certificate of moral character from
Dr. Peabody, but was not sure that he
had forgotten you sufficiently.</p>

<p>If you wish to secure your position,
you must be here by Friday night. My
love to the Professor, and sincere regards
to your father and mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>In haste, but, as ever, your friend,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Ned</span>.<br /></p>
</div>


<h3>2.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My dear old Ned</span>:—Your letter
was just like you, cross old devil that you
are! I’m coming, old horse; so write my
name down on your parchment immediately.
The Professor starts this noon,
and says he will wait over a train for me
in Endeston, where he wants to make a
visit this afternoon; so that I shall start
to-morrow morning, and meet him there.
Mother says it’s because he has so much
delicacy of feeling that he doesn’t want to
see our parting; and, by Jove! Ned, it’s
going to be hard. She doesn’t say much;
but I know how she suffers; and it makes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
me almost feel as though I was wrong to
go. I’ll bet I’ll have a handsomer sash
than you will, after all. Mother wants me
to give you the enclosed letter, which
seems mysterious to me; still I obey. I
am in a great hurry, so can’t write any
more, but shall be with you on Friday.</p>

<p class="noic">Yours,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Tom</span>.<br /></p>

<h3>3.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Ned</span>,—For though I have
never yet had the pleasure of seeing you
at our house, I still feel as though I knew
you, Tom has said so much to me of you,
and has shown so much more than he has
said. I have felt very thankful that you
were his friend; and now that this terrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
and dreadful parting is to separate me
from my only child, I am glad that you
are to be with him. I know the cause
that calls him, and I feel that it is better
for him to go than to stay; but, though I
say yes, I say it with an agony beyond
your comprehension. I want your promise
that you will not leave Tom during the
time that your country may need you;
that you will suffer nothing but death to
separate you; that you will refuse promotion
and honor, if it is to part you from
him; that you will stay by his side in the
progress of the battles that may come. It
is through your influence that he goes; I
must look to you for his safety. So make
me this promise; and, in return, what can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
I give? what can I say? This only: that
my house shall be your home; and that I
shall feel as if I had two sons instead of
one.</p></div>

<p class="p2">A bare room, the dead whiteness of
whose plastered wall is only relieved by
a coarsely colored print of the Virgin
Mary in blue and scarlet, which hangs in
a dingy gilt frame on the wall at the
head of the bed. A crack in the glass
has relieved the features of the Virgin of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
their ordinary expression of insipidity, but
has substituted therefor a look of malevolence
quite unpleasant to see. Fortunately
for the man who lies, heavily
sleeping, upon the pallet bed, this picture
is not where his eyes can rest upon it.
Beside the bed are two little stools, which
constitute all the furniture of the room,
and, indeed, all that it is well capable of
containing; for so cramped and narrow
are its dimensions, that it seems to be
scarcely more than a closet with a window
in it. Through the half-open door-way,
however, can be seen long lines of beds,
with the quiet figures of nurses and
physicians passing back and forth through
the ward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>Two people entered carefully and noiselessly
through the open door-way,—one
evidently an army physician; the other,
in a captain’s uniform now, was Tom,
bronzed and sunburnt, but the same careless,
light-hearted boy as when he left
Cambridge one year before. There was
a look of anxiety on his face now, however,
as he bent over the sleeping figure
and asked:—</p>

<p>“How is he to-day, doctor?”</p>

<p>“Improving fast, captain,” was the
reply. “His sleep is splendid,—just
what I’ve been hoping for. If he wakes
peacefully, and is conscious, he is likely
to be all right again before long; and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
shouldn’t wonder if he could rejoin his
regiment in a week or ten days.”</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven!” said Tom.</p>

<p>“And his physique,” said the doctor.
“This colonel of yours is a tough fellow,
and a brave man; yet, if he should die
to-morrow, I should simply put down his
name, and never think of him again. My
note-book is full of dead men’s names,—just
a mention and nothing more. Oh!
by the way, a gentleman called here for
you yesterday afternoon, and said he
would come again this morning. Here is
his card.”</p>

<p>“Why,” cried Tom, “it is the Professor.
See that he is shown up to me
when he comes, won’t you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, certainly! I’ll attend to that,” said
the doctor, and he rushed softly away.</p>

<p>Tom sat down by the side of the bed,
and looked at his friend’s face. It had
changed greatly, much more than his,
since they left Cambridge. The forehead
was marked now with heavy lines, and
the full beard made it seem like the
countenance of a man of forty. So old
can even a boy grow in a year. Ned had
trained himself, with great effort, to unquestioning
obedience. His criticism had
been only upon those to whom he gave
his orders, and he had struggled not to
form an opinion on those to whom his
obedience was due; thus he had become
an admirable officer. Tom sat there looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
at Ned, and thinking, thinking, he
could scarcely tell of what, until he felt
a hand touch his shoulder. He turned
and saw the Professor, and fairly hugged
him in his delight.</p>

<p>“So I have found you at last, Tom,”
said the Professor.</p>

<p>“Just think, sir,” said Tom; “it is a
year now since I have seen you.”</p>

<p>“And the end seems as far off as ever,”
said the Professor.</p>

<p>“Don’t say that,” said Tom, “because
sometimes, you know, I have to try very
hard not to think so myself.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the Professor, “you are
still the same, I see, and I am the same;
and Ned,—is this Ned?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, poor fellow,” said Tom; “he has
been sick for nearly ten days.”</p>

<p>“But how came you to be with him?”
asked the Professor. “Why are you not
with your regiment?”</p>

<p>“Sit down,” said Tom, “and I’ll tell you;
but don’t speak too loud, on his account,
you know!”</p>

<p>“Among the wonderful effects of the
war,” said the Professor, in a didactic
manner, “may be mentioned the fact that
it has made Tom thoughtful and considerate.
Well, go on!”</p>

<p>“That sounds just like you,” said Tom.
“Well, the explanation is simply this:
that I had a leave of absence for a fortnight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
given me, and just at its beginning
Ned was taken sick.”</p>

<p>“So you remained here with him, and
didn’t go home?” asked the Professor.</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Tom, simply. “I
couldn’t leave him after all we had been
through together.”</p>

<p>“What did your mother say?” asked
the Professor. “Wasn’t she disappointed?”</p>

<p>“Yes, she was disappointed,” said Tom;
“but she wrote and said that I was right.
It was hard on Ned, and hard on me, and
hard on her, especially as I haven’t been
home for a year. You see, in my last
leave of absence, there was some of the
worst fighting that we have been in, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
it would have seemed cowardly if I had
gone then.”</p>

<p>“It is hard, Tom,” said the Professor;
“but you have done nobly. But if I stay
here with Ned now, can’t you run up
North?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Tom; “it’s impossible. My
leave of absence, you see, expires in two
days, so that I shall have to give up going
home at all for the present. I’m afraid
now that Ned won’t be well enough to
satisfy me when I start for the front.
He’s been perfectly delirious, and yesterday
the doctor said was the turning-point.
If he only is conscious when he wakes
from this sleep! Do you think he has
changed?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>“Changed!” said the Professor; “he’s
not the same boy,—he’s not a boy at all.
What a developing agent this terrible war
is!”</p>

<p>“And now you must tell me about
Harvard,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” said the Professor.
“I have one or two questions to ask you
first. I want to hear about this new rebel
general who is making such havoc with
us.”</p>

<p>“Stonewall Jackson, you mean,” said
Tom. “No one knows much about him;
but Ned declares that he is, thus far, the
most striking figure of the rebellion.
Maliff, who says he knew him when he
was in command at Fort Hamilton, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
the war, showed us a picture of him, in
which he looked simply prim and neat.
The war has probably changed all that.
I think we are all a little afraid of him,
and hope to meet him in battle soon.
Some of the men think he is a supernatural
being.”</p>

<p>“The Hibernian element, I suppose,”
said the Professor.</p>

<p>“Exactly,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“And now tell me some more about
yourselves,” continued the Professor.</p>

<p>“Well, about ourselves,” said Tom,
“there is little to say. I am a captain,
as you see; and Ned is a lieutenant-colonel,
and commands our regiment,—or
what there is left of it now. We might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
both have been promoted before this; but
we were bound to stick together, and so
we have, in all sorts of places too.”</p>

<p>“I have heard,” said the Professor,
“how you have saved Ned’s life.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” said Tom. “He has done
just as much for me. We are together,
and we fight and quarrel, just as we did
at Harvard; and, when the war is over,
Ned insists that we are to go back to
Cambridge for a year longer, so as to get
our degrees; a plan which I don’t altogether
fancy.”</p>

<p>“I do,” said the Professor; “it will be
delightful to me to have the opportunity
of marking the misdemeanors of a colonel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
and perhaps of even suspending a captain.”</p>

<p>“That sounds just like you, and like
old times,” said Tom; “and now do please
tell me all about Harvard.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Ned’s voice feebly, from
the bed, “please let us hear the Harvard
news.” And so the Professor began.</p>

<small>NED’S NOTE-BOOK.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Tom has gone, but the Professor is
here still. I do not mean to stay long,—I
shall rejoin my regiment in a day or
two. In the mean time, I amuse myself,
when the Professor is not here, by scribbling
in my note-book and reading it
over. Such a book as it is now! My
own thoughts begin it; then, as we reach
the battle-fields, I have not time to think,
much less to put my thoughts in writing;
then comes a record of deaths,—poor
fellows, who wanted me to write to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
homes. How curious that record is!
Men whom I didn’t care for grew heroic
to me in those first days,—when death
was a novelty,—and I am minute in my
descriptions of them. Then, as the deaths
become more and more frequent, my descriptions
grow shorter, and I give a line
only, even to those whom I really loved.
It is strange reading, this note-book of
mine!</p>

<p>Here is an item which I find in my
note-book: “Quarrelled with Tom!” How
we have fought, to be sure! I don’t
know what this quarrel was about, but I
know how it ended. We didn’t speak
for two days, and then came another attack
from that restless creature, Stonewall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Jackson. It was such a lovely day,—fresh
and spring-like, but it soon grew
hot and dusty. Every once in a while a
bullet would whiz past; I could hear
the rumble of the artillery, and I was
terribly thirsty. I didn’t see Tom, but I
knew he was near,—we always kept close
together at such times;—still, if I had
seen him, I wouldn’t have spoken to him.
My horse had been shot from under me,
and I had cut open the head of the man
who did it; it seems strange, now that
it is all over, that I could do such a thing.
Suddenly I saw the barrel of a rifle
pointed at me. The face of the man who
was pointing it peered from behind a tree
with a malicious grin. I felt that death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
was near, and the feeling was not pleasant.
However, the situation had an element
of absurdity in it, and that made me laugh
a little. The man who was going to kill
me laughed too. I heard a little click,
a report, and his gun went up, and he
went down. Tom had shot him.</p>

<p>“Tom,” said I, with some feeling, “you
have saved my life.”</p>

<p>“There!” said he, triumphantly, “you
spoke first.”</p>

<p>I saw that I had, and I was dreadfully
provoked. However, he admitted that
he was wrong; and so, under the circumstances,
I decided that a reconciliation
was advisable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Professor has been here to-day. He
is the most delightful companion I know;
and, what is his special charm, he really
believes that he is hard and cynical, the
tender-hearted old baby! I know that he
fancies himself a second Diogenes. His
liking for us boys is very queer to me.
Tom is his pet, but he prefers to talk to
me. He discusses Tom with me, and then
he discusses me, just as if I were a third
person. To-day he told me I was a mass
of selfish pettinesses. I don’t think that
was his word, but that was what he meant;
“and yet,” said he, “you are capable of
heroic generosity.” I always know that
part of what the Professor says is said in
earnest; but I am never quite sure what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
part it is. He doesn’t fatigue me, and
doesn’t excite me, and it is well for me
that he is here; still, I am impatient to get
back again. He has told me about Tom’s
staying with me, instead of going home.
I don’t know what to say about it; I don’t
know what to think. It makes me want
to die for him; nothing else that I can do
seems sufficient. When this war is over,
I suppose Tom will marry and forget me.
I never will go near his wife—I shall
hate her. Now, that is a very silly thing
for a lieutenant-colonel to write. I don’t
care, it is true.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I wonder if I am so very selfish, after
all. I like refinement and elegance, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
I hate dirt; and I do like to have people
care for me and do things to oblige me.
But my first thought is not always of myself;
and I don’t think I am unjust to
others, because of myself. And, if I desire
the sympathy and appreciation of
others, I am sure it is not wrong.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C’est qu’un cœur bien atteint veut qu’on
soit tout à lui.</i>”</p>

<p>I can’t remember, though, just now, a
single unselfish thing that I have ever
done, unless it was giving some of the
fruit and jelly that the Professor brought
me yesterday to a poor fellow with hungry
eyes, whom I saw glaring at them through
the door. That wouldn’t have been generous,
either, if he hadn’t been a rebel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Giving aid and comfort to the enemy is
the only generous action that I can discover
of mine, after all my self-analysis.
Confound self-analysis, any way! It is
only another form of selfishness, mingled
with morbid conceit. If I did what I
ought to do, without thinking about myself
at all, it would be better for me; but
I haven’t anything to do just now, except
scribble away here, and it is dreadfully
stupid.</p>

<p>How talking with the Professor has set
me to thinking of Harvard again! Now
that the lights are glimmering at intervals
through the ward, I can see the yard, with
Holworthy and Stoughton and Hollis
beaming away from their windows at each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
other, and Massachusetts standing a little
apart, as becomes its greater age, but
benignant in its seclusion. I hear the
voices of singing in the yard, on the steps,
and under the trees; I can see fellows
sitting round the tables in their rooms,
studying and not studying; I can hear
recitations made to the different professors
and tutors; and just as the bell for morning
prayers, which I still hate, begins to
clang upon my memory, I remember that
I am here in a hospital, while we are still
fighting and killing each other for the
sake of the country that has given us all
we enjoy. I shall be out soon, I know.
There is always good prospect of a battle
when I feel this way; and yet I do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
horribly loathe the tint of blood which has
seemed to rest on everything I have seen
or dreamed of for a year past. How I
hate war, and yet how wholly I am
absorbed in it! I am getting feverish;
I shall write no more to-day.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In looking over my note-book, I find
something which, luckily for me, I had
almost forgotten; and that is, the prediction
of my friend Mooney. Poor idiot!
he was shot the first time that we were
under fire. How pleasant it would have
been for me in all the work I have been
through, if I had remembered that prophecy!
How it would have aided my recovery
in my sickness, if I had been haunted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
by those words! I am to meet a dishonorable
death for a dishonorable action,
am I? The only dishonorable action I
can commit is to go over to Stonewall Jackson,
and learn how to fight. By Jove! I do
admire that man. He is what too few
officers on either the Union or the Rebel
sides are, unselfish and in earnest. But
I don’t think that I shall join him, for all
that; and, if I did, I should not be likely
to meet with death,—his luck and his
pluck would take me through.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Professor has confided to me a plan
of his, which delights me. He says that
he will go North, and bring Tom’s mother
on to Washington, if her health permits.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
As Tom’s father is in Europe at present,
and as it would be highly unpleasant, to
use the mildest term, for a lady to travel
alone to Washington, knowing nothing of
the place and its peculiarities, it is very
thoughtful and very kind, and something
more, in the Professor to do this. Then
Tom can run up to Washington for a day
or two to see her, poor fellow! and all, or
rather part, of his great generosity will be
rewarded. The Professor is a brick to think
of it; and I have made him promise to start
to-morrow. And when he goes, I shall
go too, only in the other direction. How
happy this will make Tom!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I don’t know what makes me think of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
our class-day now, but I do wonder who
had the rooms which Tom and I engaged
for our spread. Perhaps it’s the contrast
between salad and strawberries, and hardtack
and corned-beef; though now everything
seems to me to be saturated with
gruel. I wonder if Tiny Snow was at class-day
this year! She was an object of awe to
me in Freshman year; then I despised the
sex when I was a Sophomore; and then in
Junior year I saw a good deal of her.
She had a way of drooping her head a
little; and then, with a sort of shy little
gulp, raising it, and making her eyes
childlike and plaintive. It was quite
pleasant, even after familiarity with it had
destroyed its novelty. I wrote some verses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
to her once, and sent them to “The
Harvard Magazine;” but they came into
the hands of an editor who was gone on
her himself, and he very properly rejected
them. Once I showed Tiny, quite by
accident, the Etruscan locket which I
got abroad, and which Tom admired so
much that I had his initials cut on it to
give to him.</p>

<p>“Oh, how lovely!” said Tiny. “Who is
it for?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you see the initials?” said I.</p>

<p>“T. S.,” said she, innocently; “who can
it be?”</p>

<p>I thought there seemed something like
a blush upon her cheek as she spoke; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
I told her that T. S. was some one I cared
a great deal about.</p>

<p>“Is she pretty?” asked Tiny.</p>

<p>“She!” I answered; “it isn’t any girl;
it’s my chum, Tom, you know.”</p>

<p>Then she really colored; and a little
while afterward I remembered that those
were her initials. How she must have
hated me,—perhaps!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have eaten a real breakfast at last, and
am upon my feet again. The Professor
has gone, and I am going at once. How
curious it will be to come out of this
dream, and go back again to work! The
doctor begs me not to get excited, and
yet tells me that in three days I shall be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
as well as ever. I have been excited for
a year now, and I go to the front this very
afternoon. I am rather thin, and my shirt
feels something like an air-box; but I shall
get over all that soon. We are to make
an attack before long, I understand.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I am back in camp. This is the last
entry that I shall make in this note-book
for some time to come. I am alarmed a
little about Tom. I think he is going to
be sick; he seems excited and feverish,
and yet dull. However, he has brightened
up wonderfully since I told him
about the Professor’s intention; and I am
not sure but that it was a dreadful homesickness
that oppressed him when I first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
met him. He won’t see a doctor; he
laughs the idea to scorn, and says he is
only tired and overworked, and that, if I
can manage to secure him a little rest, he
will soon be all right. But he is dying to
see his mother, he confesses to me, and I
am not surprised to hear it.</p>

<p>I said that this is the last entry I shall
make here. I am not sure now but that
these are the last words which I shall ever
write. I take charge of a small expedition
to-night, with men whom I have personally
selected for the purpose; and we
are to destroy the bridge above here.
It must be done at once. Jackson is
near there, and we expect and fear an
attack from him. The work is delicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
rather than difficult; but it is sufficiently
dangerous for me to commend
my soul to God before I start upon it.
Good-by, little note-book, perhaps forever.
If Tom and I return safe,—and Tom
will, I am sure,—why, then, perhaps, I
may tell you all about this coming night’s
work; but, if not, you will be destroyed,
unread; and so farewell.</p>

<small>MIDNIGHT.</small></h2>
</div>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Then came a blinding flash, a deafening roar,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And dissonant cries of terror and dismay;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Blood trickled down the river’s reedy shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And with the dead he lay.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="p2">A starlit sky, dead silence all around,
only the river’s murmur breaking it. The
moonbeams shining on the forest-path
mark all the shadows with a dazzling
light, bringing weird and fantastic outlines
forth, where brush and hedges line
the dusty road, and making the parched
fields, almost destitute of vegetation, shine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
like burnished sheets of dead white light.
And along this road came slowly, with
muffled tramp, a little body of men, their
dark figures darker by contrast with the
gleaming barrels of their rifles, which the
moonlight seemed to tinge with silvery
fire. They came along so quietly, so
noiselessly, now hidden from view in a
curve of the road, and now appearing
again. And still all was quiet.</p>

<p>And then a little tongue of flame ran
quickly and noiselessly up into the black
darkness; and in a moment more all was
blaze and smoke. The work was done,—the
bridge was destroyed.</p>

<p>Down in the road around the bridge
the men were grouped,—the fire giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
them a ruddy coloring,—a tint of blood.
Two figures were especially prominent,
and seemed to be directing their movements.</p>

<p>“Well, Tom,” said Ned, “does this
remind you of bonfires in the yard at
Cambridge?”</p>

<p>“Not much,” said Tom, dispiritedly.</p>

<p>“Why, Tom, what is the matter with
you?” asked Ned, anxiously.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Tom. “I feel
nervous and apprehensive.”</p>

<p>“I ought not to have let you come with
me,” said Ned. “It was weak and selfish
in me to consent. You are feverish and
excited, Tom; and you ought to have
rested.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>“Just as if I was going to let you go
off into danger without me!” said Tom.</p>

<p>“I am much obliged to you for the care
you take of me,” said Ned; “but you see
the work has been done without any
trouble. The rebs are two miles away;
and this will prevent them from making
a detour, and getting in our rear if we
advance.”</p>

<p>“Ned,” said Tom, “do you think that
the Professor will bring my mother on to
Washington with him?”</p>

<p>“Think!” said Ned. “I am sure he
will, and that, when we return to camp,
we shall find a message from her to you.
Perhaps he’ll charter a train, and bring on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
a host of your female admirers, victorious
masher of female hearts!”</p>

<p>“Don’t rough me, Ned,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“Well, now I know that you are going
to be sick, Tom,” said Ned, “when you
take that piteous tone, instead of answering
me back. By Jove, there goes a
beam, crash; and look, the fire has entirely
died out of the other. We can’t leave the
work half done in this way, we must hurry
and finish it. The rebel pickets are
probably back in camp by this time. Tom,
order four men, and row that boat over to
the other side for me.”</p>

<p>“Why, Ned!” asked Tom, “what are
you going to do?”</p>

<p>“The fire has died out over there,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Ned, “and the other beam is left. Here,
O’Brien, I want that axe. I am going to
cross on it, and cut it off where it is
charred. Get the boat ready at once,
captain.”</p>

<p>“But, Ned, that is very dangerous,”
interposed Tom.</p>

<p>“Obey orders!” said Ned, impatiently
and angrily; and Tom, with a reproachful
glance, left him at once.</p>

<p>Only a slender beam now hung over
the flood. On this Ned started to cross,
balancing himself with the axe, the group
of men watching him eagerly. An inch
to the right or to the left, and all was lost.
The flames were decreasing now, yet still
the beam stood. Then the boat started<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
out slowly across the river. The attention
of all was turned towards it for an instant;
and, in the mean time, Ned had almost
gained the other side. One, two, three
blows on the charred part of the beam,
and it wavered and fell with a crash as
Ned leaped lightly upon the bank. He
waved his hand triumphantly, and ran
down to meet the boat, which, more than
half way across, was now struggling with
the powerful current, and yet was visibly
nearing the shore. He waved his cap,
and started down the river-bank into the
copse to meet it. Only two steps, two
little steps down the bank, and from the
tangled foliage a powerful hand grasped
his throat, the cold barrel of a pistol was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
pressed to his cheek, and a voice fairly
hissed the whisper into his ears:—</p>

<p>“Silence! or you are a dead man!”</p>

<p>And for reply, with one mighty effort,
he threw off the hand; and, as the pistol-shot
resounded through the air, his voice
rang out, clear and strong on the still
night:—</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Back to the camp, for your lives!
The enemy is upon us!</span>”</p>

<p>In an instant more he was seized; and
one of the men who had crept upon him
said:—</p>

<p>“Damn you, you hound! you have
spoiled all our plans.”</p>

<p>Then Ned smiled serenely, and looked
calmly at the man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>“But we shall bag four or five of them,
any way, lieutenant,” said one of the men,—“those
in the boat down there.”</p>

<p>And then Ned started and turned pale;
but it was too late. Tom and two others
had already landed, and were in the hands
of two or three of the rebel pickets.</p>

<p>“O Tom, Tom!” cried Ned, “why did
you not turn back?”</p>

<p>But Tom did not answer, and only
stared vacantly and stupidly at Ned.</p>

<p>“The captain’s sick, sir,” said one of
the men who had been captured.</p>

<p>“Drunk, more likely,” said the rebel
lieutenant, with an oath.</p>

<p>“He was taken in the boat,” continued
the man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is as I feared,” said Ned; “he is in
a high fever, as I was.” At this the rebel
lieutenant drew back. “Oh! it is not
contagious,” said Ned, with a world of
scorn in his voice; and the rebel lieutenant
resumed his former position.</p>

<p>“Tom, don’t you know me?” asked
Ned. “Oh, what will be the end of this,
I wonder!”</p>

<p>“Libby Prison,” sneered the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“Tell my mother to come and see me
at Libby,” said Tom, half stupidly. Upon
this the chorus naturally raised an insulting
shout, and one poor brute indulged
in some ribald remark. In an instant,
Tom had struck him across the face; in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
another instant, Tom himself lay on the
ground senseless and stunned by a blow
from the butt of one of the rebel rifles. It
was at this instant, while Ned in anguish
and desperation was struggling with his
captors, that the sound of horses’ hoofs
was heard coming nearer and nearer, and
three or four officers rode quickly up.
The central figure of the group was a
compact, sinewy man, of medium height,
with a full, untrimmed beard, and a face,
as Ned could see by the dim light of the
fire which some of the men were now
lighting a little distance off, furrowed with
the lines of thought, of care, and anxiety.
The eyes were large and expressive, the
features clearly cut, and the mouth, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
though partially hidden by a thin mustache,
showed indomitable firmness. A
grand head in many respects, and one
which made it evident to Ned that he was
in the presence of the dreaded Stonewall
Jackson.</p>

<p>“What is the matter here?” he asked
briefly.</p>

<p>“They have destroyed the bridge,
general,” was the reply.</p>

<p>Stonewall Jackson turned, and whispered
to one of his companions who
rode away. Then he continued:—</p>

<p>“Are these prisoners?”</p>

<p>“Yes, general,” said the lieutenant,—“these
four.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>“A lieutenant-colonel, I see?” said
Stonewall Jackson.</p>

<p>Ned simply bowed in reply. Then
Stonewall Jackson looked at Tom, and
said:—</p>

<p>“And who is this here?”</p>

<p>At this, Tom half raised himself, and
then fell back again.</p>

<p>“May I tell you?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Jackson; “what is
it?”</p>

<p>“He is in a high fever, which has been
coming on for some time,” said Ned; “and
one of these men struck him with the butt
of his rifle.”</p>

<p>“After he had surrendered?” asked
Jackson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“After he was taken prisoner,” said
Ned.</p>

<p>“He shall be taken to camp and attended
to,” said Stonewall Jackson. But,
when they touched Tom, he uttered a
sharp cry of pain; and the men drew
back.</p>

<p>“We will let him remain here, then,”
said Jackson, after a word or two more
with his companions. “Lieutenant, you
will keep watch here, and down the river’s
bank, until daybreak, and then report at
head-quarters to me with the prisoners.
As for you, sir,” he continued, addressing
Ned, “you can remain here through the
night with your friend,—under parole, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
course, not to break your bonds. Do
you accept?”</p>

<p>“Most thankfully,” said Ned, with a
gratitude in his voice and accent far beyond
what his words expressed.</p>

<p>“He is a handsome boy,” said Jackson,
looking again at the still unconscious
Tom. “Keep the other prisoners under
strict guard, lieutenant; but treat this
gentleman who is under parole with all
possible respect. Hark! what is that?
Midnight!”</p>

<p>And, as he paused to listen, the distant
sound of bells rang faintly out upon the
air. Midnight; and for an instant utter
stillness upon air and earth and water.
And then Tom groaned painfully; and, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Ned bent anxiously over him, Stonewall
Jackson said:—</p>

<p>“I shall see you in the morning,
Colonel.” And Ned thanked him once
again; and the noise of the horses’ hoofs
came more and more faintly, and at last
died away entirely.</p>

<p>Then Ned knelt down beside Tom, and
looked steadily at him. Tom half opened
his eyes, and then closed them again with
a weary moan that went to Ned’s very
heart. “Don’t you know me, Tom?” he
said.</p>

<p>“I shall see my mother to-morrow,”
said Tom, “after waiting two years. I
couldn’t go before,—I couldn’t leave Ned
when he was sick.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>Ned hid his face in his hands, and
groaned. Tom closed his eyes again, and
seemed to pass into a fitful slumber. The
men had built a great fire a little way
apart; and its gleams fell upon Tom’s face,
just as the firelight had done in the Professor’s
room, five years before, when Ned
first met him. How well he remembered
that night! He laid his hand on Tom’s
hot brow, and smoothed back his tangled
hair. How lovely his face was in this fitful,
ruddy glow! How much he had sacrificed
for Ned, and now Ned had ruined
him! It was dreadful to Ned. He threw
himself on the grass beside Tom, and put
his face on Tom’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“I am going to cut recitation to-day,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
muttered Tom. “Hang that old Ned!
He is always vexed about something or
other. I’m going to enlist, mother; I
must, you see,—oh, I must, I must, I
must! Good-by!”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t, Tom!” groaned Ned.</p>

<p>And then Tom sat up, and gazed wildly
and vacantly at Ned, without a trace of
recognition in his face.</p>

<p>“Why, Professor,” said he. “I couldn’t
leave Ned possibly! We’ve been through
everything together; and he might not
be cared for properly, if I were to leave
him sick and alone. Mother says that I
am right; and I shall see her to-morrow,—I
shall see her to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“It is as I feared,” said Ned, half to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
himself; “he is in a high fever. If I can
only get him down to the river-bank there,
where I can bathe his head.”</p>

<p>And, putting Tom’s limp arm around
his own neck, Ned managed with some
difficulty to carry him a few steps to the
river’s brink.</p>

<p>“There, Tom,” he said, “I’ll bathe your
head for you, poor fellow!”</p>

<p>“Here is the river,” said Tom; “and we
are going to see mother in a boat. It’s a
dangerous thing, Ned, to cross on that
beam. <span class="smcap">Obey orders!</span> And now it is too
late, too late! God only knows whether I
shall ever see my mother again.” And
now, as Tom became quiet once more,
Ned sat there, and bathed his head; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the river continued the noise of its rushing
waters, and the wavelets splashed gently
upon the shore, and against the wooden
sides of the boat,—the boat! And now
for the first time Ned saw the means of
deliverance within his power. The idea
fairly swept over his mind. To put Tom
into the boat, and gain the other side,
would be the work of a few moments only:
and it could be done; for the rebel squad
was dispersed along the shore, and the
one man who sat by the fire a few yards
off seemed fast asleep. But then, even
as the thought of a possibility of freedom
for Tom made him exultant, there came
the recollection of his parole. He still sat
by Tom’s side, and mechanically now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
smoothed back the hair from his forehead,
and as mechanically repeated to himself,
“word of honor, word of honor, word of
honor,” until the very leaves upon the
trees seemed to rustle in rhythm with the
cadence; and then, with this dull, heavy
oppression on his mind, the words seemed
to turn into French and Latin and Greek,
and to make new and fantastic combinations
in his brain. “God help me!” he
groaned. “I am going mad.” And then
he knelt and prayed; and still the river
rushed along, and still that one black
figure sat there by the fire, as if half
asleep. Then Ned saw him move slowly,
and heard him whisper hoarsely,
“Colonel! Colonel!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you mean me?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes. Speak softer, and come up
here.”</p>

<p>Wondering and confused, Ned obeyed.
The man turned a rough, unshaven face
to him, and said:—</p>

<p>“You don’t know me, I see?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“I know you, though. Mighty peart
you be now; but you wasn’t so three
weeks ago. You was took pretty sick
then, and lying in a hospittle.”</p>

<p>“Well, what of it?” said Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, you’re a stoutish kind of man
now, ain’t you? But, Lord!” and the fellow
laughed to himself, “I could just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
chaw you up in no time. I should kinder
like to have a gouge at you, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Ned; “but if that is
all you have to say, I shall have to leave
you, and attend to my friend.”</p>

<p>“You’re a real perlite man,” said the
man, in a wondering sort of way; “and yet
you’re a Yank. You must attend to your
friend. That’s fair; and why? Because
when you was sick, he took care of you.
I see it; I was in the hospittle likewise at
the time. I had just got up as you was
took down. Don’t yer remember me?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Ned, impatiently.</p>

<p>“Well, you give me some fruit and jelly
that was sent me one day. I never had
such a good time in my life as eating them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
things. The nurse, she says, ‘Don’t
waste ’em on him; he’s a rebel,’ she says;
and what did you say? You says, ‘Don’t
let’s think nothing about Rebs and Feds
here,’ says you, ‘but let’s forget all about
it; and then I liked you. I like you now.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear it,” said Ned; “but
I must see to my friend.”</p>

<p>“You care for him about as you would
for a gal, don’t you?” said this Virginia
barbarian then. “Well, he’s pootier than
any gal I ever see anywhar. Look here,
this is jest what I want to say to you. Ef
you should put him and you in that thar
boat, and float down the river, you’d come
to your own lines. Ef I should see you
do it, I’d stop you; but I’m going to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
a snooze by the fire here, for I’m powerful
tired. Ef I should wake up, I should fire
on you, ef I saw you; and so would
others. But I can’t allus aim straight in
the dark; and, whar one aims, others is
likely to. Now I have done you a good
turn for what you’ve did to me; and ef
ever we meet again, by God, I’ll kill you.”</p>

<p>“But I can’t in honor escape,” said
Ned.</p>

<p>“Of course you can’t,” said the man;
“and, if you could, of course you wouldn’t
tell me. There, I don’t want no more to say
to you. Just git, that’s all you’ve got to do.”</p>

<p>Ned went back full of this new temptation.
The other pickets were dispersed,
the river rolled on invitingly, and Tom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
seemed to be sleeping more quietly than
before.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I can get him exchanged in
the morning,” said Ned, “since he’s so ill.
I am glad that he is sleeping.”</p>

<p>Just at this moment, Tom awoke hurriedly,
and looked about him wildly and
vacantly, then fell back again.</p>

<p>“Oh, if Ned were only here!” he
groaned,—“if Ned were only here!”</p>

<p>“Ned is here, Tom, close beside you,
as always,” said Ned, softly.</p>

<p>“If Ned were here,” muttered Tom, “he
would help me. O Ned, Ned! do come,
do please come and help me to see my
mother!”</p>

<p>“I will,” whispered Ned, solemnly. Not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
an instant was to be lost. Without daring
to think, without daring to look around
him, then he lifted Tom and laid him in
the boat. The keel grated on the pebbly
shore. He started nervously and turned;
but the faithless picket was laboriously
sleeping. In an instant more he had
thrown off his outer garments; and, with
the rope of the boat tied around his neck,
he half swam, half drifted, with the strong
current down the stream. Weak from his
late sickness, and the excitement and
efforts of the night, his swimming soon
exhausted him; and he clung to the side
of the boat, and drifted with it. The sky
now was marked with black cloud-rifts,
that made strange and fantastic outlines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
on its luminous background; and the white
light of the moon was growing gray. On
each side of him he saw the black trees
standing in groups, now dense, now scattered,
along the shores; while ever in his
ears was the strange murmur of the torrent,
broken only by Tom’s incoherent
muttering as he lay in the boat. Then
suddenly came the sharp report of a rifle;
and he knew that his escape was discovered
at last. He heard the bullets
whistle by him, then one grazed the side
of the boat, but luckily did not come near
Tom. At last the firing ceased; but the
boat seemed to be drifting into a little
cove. He made one desperate effort to
push her more into the main current, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
in vain; for his strength was now entirely
gone. Then he gave one cry, as he saw
the first faint gleam of dawn in the east,
and the boat struck him, bruised and fainting,
against the shore. He crawled feebly
upon the bank, the rope still around his
neck; and then, stunned and bruised, all
consciousness forsook him. The last
thing which he knew was, that the birds
were just beginning to twitter in the
trees.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When he awoke it was later in the day;
and the warm light and air of the forenoon
was streaming into his tent. An orderly
was standing by the entrance.</p>

<p>“Where is Tom?” he asked hoarsely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“The captain is there;” and the orderly
pointed to the other side of the tent, where
Ned saw a figure lying muffled in coats
and blankets. He hardly dared to ask
what he dreaded to learn, his voice seemed
clogged and heavy in his throat; and
finally, when he did speak, it was in a
hoarse and tremulous whisper:—</p>

<p>“Is he dead?”</p>

<p>“Dead?” said the orderly, surprised;
“why, no, colonel! But he is dreadfully
sick; and they are going to take him to
the hospital, after you have seen him and
spoken with him.”</p>

<p>“Go outside,” said Ned, briefly, “and let
no one enter under any pretext whatever.”
And, as the orderly obeyed, he threw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
himself down beside Tom, who was sleeping
restlessly under the influence apparently
of some opiate.</p>

<p>He looked at him, laid his hand upon
his forehead, and then bent over and kissed
his hot face.</p>

<p>“Tom,” he said. But there was no
answer, no movement. “I have come to
bid you good-by, Tom,” he said; “I am
going back to deliver myself up.” But
still Tom slept, and groaned.</p>

<p>“Not one word of good-by, Tom,” said
poor Ned. “And yet this is the last time—the
very last time—God help me!—that
we shall see each other, that I shall see
you. O my darling, my darling, my darling!
please hear me. The only one I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
ever loved at all, the only one who has
ever loved me. The last words that you
heard from me were those of anger and
impatience, and now, poor fellow! you
cannot speak even to say good-by. Hear
me say it. When you get well again,
have some memory of my bending over
you and saying it, and telling you that I
was saying good-by, good-by, good-by!
O Tom, my darling! don’t forget it. If
you knew how I love you, how I have
loved you in all my jealous, morbid moods,
in all my exacting selfishness,—O Tom!
my darling, my darling! can’t you say one
word, one little word before we part,—just
one little word, if it were only my
name? Oh, please, please speak to me!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Don’t you remember when we were examined
for college together? You sat
across the hall. I saw you there; and I
wanted to go over and help you. And
your picture, Tom, that we quarrelled
about,—I have it now, Tom; it will be
with me when they bury me. Tom, don’t
you remember that picture? It was the
night when I determined to go to war that
you gave me that picture; it was just
before we enlisted. O Tom! why did I
let you come at all? You will see your
mother, Tom; and you will go home now,
and marry, and be happy, and forget me.
Oh, no, no, no, Tom! you won’t do that;
you can’t do that. You won’t forget Ned,
darling; he was something to you; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
you were all the world to him. O Tom!
Tom! please say one word to him.” He
stopped and was silent. Tom only
moaned restlessly in his sleep; and there
seemed to be a painful death-like silence
inside the tent, while outside was the
bright life of the morning and the busy
murmur of the camp.</p>

<p>“Ah, well!” he said, “it is better so. He
would not let me go if he were conscious;
he would say that I must stay with him;
and that cannot be. He need not know
that I am dead, as I shall be, until he himself
is well once again. Good-by, Tom!
good-by! and God bless you forever, my
darling!”</p>

<p>And calmly, yet with a dreadful pang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
at his heart, he stooped, and once more
kissed the flushed face of his friend; then
quickly, as if impelled by some force not
his own, without daring to look backward,
he rushed from the tent.</p>

<p class="p2">Stonewall Jackson sat in his tent,
writing rapidly on a rough pine table.
There was in the man, in spite of his old
coat stained here and there with mud, and
his awkwardness of position and figure,
an appearance of power,—power conscious
and self-sustaining. At a first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
glance he seemed an old Virginia farmer;
but an instant’s careful scrutiny showed,
beneath his awkward simplicity, the grace
of a true soldier, while the slow, hesitating
speech had in it an undertone which made
it evident that at times each word might
be charged with fire and eloquence and
life. As he moved one hand to brush back
the thinned hair on his temples, this hot
afternoon, a staff-officer entered the tent.</p>

<p>“I have some curious news, General,”
he said.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Jackson, briefly;
for a word was a power with this man,
and he never wasted power.</p>

<p>“The prisoner who broke his parole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
this morning has returned here,” said the
officer.</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed Jackson, “has he
given himself up?”</p>

<p>“Yes, General; they have him in confinement,
and he has asked to see you.”</p>

<p>“To see me, lieutenant!” said Stonewall
Jackson. “That will make no difference.
He is to be shot at sunrise.”</p>

<p>“Very well, General;” and the lieutenant
turned to depart.</p>

<p>“Stop a moment, though,” said Jackson.
“I should like to know what defence,
what excuse he has to offer. Have him
brought here.”</p>

<p>“Very well, General. But he is to be
shot?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>“Certainly, sir!”</p>

<p>Jackson laid down his pen, and folded
his arms before him on the rough board
which served him as a writing-table. He
had not long to wait. In less than five
minutes, Ned appeared, guarded by two
soldiers, his face pale but determined. He
met Stonewall Jackson’s scrutinizing look
clearly and fearlessly, yet respectfully.
“You may withdraw,” said Jackson to the
men. “Now, sir, you wish to see me.
What have you to say?”</p>

<p>“I broke my parole this morning,” said
Ned.</p>

<p>“I know it, sir,” said Jackson; “and,
having some compunction for your violation
of honor, you have tried as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
manœuvre giving yourself up again. You
have made a mistake, sir.”</p>

<p>“It is just because I knew you would
misconstrue my motive and my action thus
that I asked to see you,” said Ned. “I
wish to explain.”</p>

<p>“No explanation is possible, sir,” cried
Stonewall Jackson; “and this will avail
you nothing.”</p>

<p>“Oh! wait a moment,” cried Ned, impetuously.
“Don’t deceive yourself. I
know what I am doing; I knew a few
hours ago, when I left the Union lines,
what I was doing. I came here to die,—to
be shot! Do you hear,—to be shot!
I broke my parole; I expected no mercy
from you,—I ask for none, I would take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
none. I claim only my right, and my right
is death.”</p>

<p>“Then why did you give yourself up, if
you knew death must be your fate?” asked
Jackson.</p>

<p>“Death has not frightened me very
much,” said Ned, contemptuously.</p>

<p>“There is something about you,” said
Stonewall Jackson, “which makes me
wish to respect you. I see you are not a
coward.”</p>

<p>“And I wish you to see that I am not a
liar,” answered Ned. “I gave myself up
to death; and I wish you to bear witness,
that, having sinned, I accepted the penalty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>“But why sin?” said Stonewall Jackson.</p>

<p>“I will tell you why,” said Ned. “I
have only one person in the world to care
for: I have no family, no relatives, only
this one friend. He was all the world to
me, and I was something to him. When
the war broke out, I enlisted, and he went
with me. We have been side by side
through everything. He saved my life in
battle at the risk of his own; and a few
weeks ago, when I was taken sick by
fever, and he had a leave of absence, he
gave up his home, he sacrificed everything,
to watch by me. Last night he was
taken sick while with the party at the
bridge, when in another day he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
have been with his mother at Washington.
You paroled me. I was left there with
him, and he raved and groaned until I
could bear it no longer. Every word he
said seemed to stab me to the heart.
Then I saw the river and the boat; the
men were scattered, and the means of escape
were at hand. I hesitated. I
thought of my parole; and then I thought
of him a prisoner, an invalid, a corpse perhaps,
if he waited here, while back of us
his mother was hastening to meet her only
son. He had given up so much for me,
and what had I done for him? It seemed
as if I must get him away; and then he
cried out again, ‘Ned, Ned, won’t you help
me?’ And I said, ‘Yes!’ And I knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
that <em>yes</em> was death to me. Oh! you see
I am prepared. I have not tried to arouse
your sympathy or your compassion, I have
only told you the bare facts. Do you think,
if I hoped for life, if I cared for pardon from
you, that I could not say more, that I
could not pour out words of fire and blood
to show you what our friendship is, and
what last night’s temptation was? I ask
no mercy; and you could give me none if
you wished it: my act must bring its consequences.
Only I wished you to see that I
was neither liar nor coward; that, having
forfeited my life, I did not evade the payment
of my debt; in a word, that I was
enough of a gentleman to be worthy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the great privilege of serving in my country’s
cause.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Jackson, “you are not only
a gentleman, but a soldier. I love war for
itself, I glory in it; but it saddens me
when it brings with it the useless sacrifice
of such a life as yours.”</p>

<p>“I am not a soldier,” said Ned, quietly.
“I hate war; I hate to have to long for the
death of such a man as you are. But I
am ready for all that, when there is a
cause at stake.”</p>

<p>“A cause at stake!” said Stonewall
Jackson. “Well, God be with the right!”</p>

<p>“God is with the right,” said Ned;
“and time will show us which is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
right. Ah! if I could live to see that
time!”</p>

<p>“Be thankful rather,” said Jackson,
“that you are going to die before you find
you are in the wrong. I wish you had
been with me in this campaign.”</p>

<p>“If it had been possible,” said Ned, and
then he stopped.</p>

<p>“I should like,” said Stonewall Jackson,
slowly, “though doubtless you consider
me a rebel and a traitor, to have you shake
hands with me.”</p>

<p>“Not with a rebel or a traitor,” said
Ned, “but with a sincere and honest man
whom I respect and honor;” and with this
grasp of hands, these two great souls
gazed in each other’s eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>“And now you know what I must say,”
said Stonewall Jackson.</p>

<p>“I know it,” Ned replied.</p>

<p>“Do not think me cruel, do not think
me lacking in human feeling,” Stonewall
Jackson continued; “but war has its duties
as well as peace. God help those
who must execute these duties!”</p>

<p>“There is but one thing you can do,”
said Ned, tranquilly.</p>

<p>“There is but one thing I can do,” repeated
Jackson. “You will be shot at
sunrise.” He called the men outside.
“Give this gentleman,” he said, “as good
accommodations as the camp affords. See
that he is left by himself, and is undisturbed
to-night.—All letters, all directions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
which you may wish to give, shall
be forwarded to the North,” he continued,
addressing Ned; “and if you wish anything
to be done about burial”—</p>

<p>“I shall wish nothing,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“In that case,” said Jackson, with
princely courtesy, “I have only to say
farewell.” He rose again, and took Ned’s
hand; then the soldiers marched away,
and he was left in his tent alone.</p>

<small>THE LAST LETTER HOME.</small></h2>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Professor</span>,—I am writing to
you the last words I shall ever say, the
last thoughts I shall ever think, the last
farewell to all I have ever known and
loved. To-morrow, at daybreak, I am to
be shot. There is nothing that can possibly
prevent it,—this is my last night on
earth. Am I resigned to my lot? am I
willing to lose my life? I cannot tell, it
seems so like a dream. It is terrible to
me to think that this is the end of all
my youth and hope; and you will understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
me when I say that I do dread
and fear death. Yet I am calm and self-possessed.
I am half dead already, indeed,
for my end seems inevitable; and I do
not suffer so much as I wonder. I seem
to have lost all volition, and, as it were, to
have gone out of myself. A little while
ago I wound up my watch; and then the
uselessness of that performance struck me,
and I said, half aloud, “Poor Ned!” and
then laughed at myself for doing it. As
my laugh died away, there was a cold silence
around which chilled me through
and through. Yes, I must be half dead
already. It is only when I think of Tom
that the life seems to rush back again; and
as I believe this sort of torpor is well for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
me, I dare not trust to myself write to him.
Besides, he must get well; and so you
must try and keep my death hidden from
him for a time. You can tell him, better
than I could, that my last thought will be
of him, and that I cannot trust myself to
say farewell to him. Even now, I have this
cruel uncertainty about his health, and I do
not know but what you may lose us both.</p>

<p>Stonewall Jackson is a hero. I never
thought that I could say that of any rebel,
but I am glad that I have known him. He
will work us more terrible injury, I fear;
but I am sure that he will not live long.
The excitement of this war is killing him;
and here, when I so thoroughly admire
him, I have to rejoice that he is doomed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
How strange war is,—stranger and
stranger now than ever! Oh! if I could
only see the end,—if I could only know
whether we shall gain our country by all
this blood, and if Tom will live, I could
die perfectly contented. There is Tom
again, you see. I have to think of him in
spite of myself. When you tell him my
story, you can give him this letter, if he
wants it, as perhaps he will.</p>

<p>And now good-by for yourself. It is not
well for me to write,—it brings me back
to life too much; but I cannot die without
telling you something of my feeling for
you. Do you think that I have not fully
appreciated all your sympathy, all your
kindness, all the wealth of intellect and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
culture which you have laid before me? I
always have had a sort of hope, that some
time, when I should win some great honor,
and the world should applaud, I could say,
“Look here; here is the man to whom I
owe all this; here is the man who advised
me, who guided me; the man with the
strong soul and the woman’s tenderness,
who loved youth and beauty, and sympathized
with sorrow. You take off your
hats to me; but I kneel before him.” But
all that is over now, and you have only a
numb good-by from a man who is to be
shot in a few hours.</p>

<p>My body will not be sent North. When
I am dead, I am dead; and here or there,
it matters not where it is buried, to me nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
to any one else. But if you ever want to
think of me, and to feel that I am near,
walk through the yard at Harvard, over
by Holworthy, in the lovely evenings of
the spring weather. It was at such
a season, and at such a time, that
I last saw the dear old place; and,
if I ever can be anywhere on earth
again, it is there that I should choose to
be. Ah, if I could only see Harvard once
again! God bless it forever and forever!
I wonder how many visions of its elm-trees
have swept before dying eyes here in
Virginia battle-fields!</p>

<p>Ah, well! there is only good-by to say
once more. When he asks for me, tell
him that I constantly think of him, that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
am well and happy. Don’t let him know
the truth until he is clearly out of danger,
and then tell him all. It is not so very
hard to bear; and I am sure now that I
shall never be forgotten by him, and that
nothing can ever come between us now.
Tell him the only thing, after God, worth
living for and worth dying for, is our
country,—our noble country. Oh! she
must be strong and glorious and united,
at any cost. I feel it and I know it. And
now good-by, once more and forever.</p>
</div>

<p>He sealed and directed the letter; then,
throwing himself on the blanket in the
corner of the tent, fell into a deep, refreshing
slumber. He woke to feel the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
grasp of a hand upon his shoulder, to see
a file of men beside him. Without a word
he rose and went with them. They led
him out a little from the camp, where it
seemed quiet. He saw them stand before
him; he heard one preliminary order given,
and caught the flash of rifle-barrels in the
early morning sunlight. Then there was
a noise and disturbance in the camp beyond,
and a voice cried out:—</p>

<p>“It’s an attack by the Federals!”</p>

<p>Ned turned involuntarily. And with
these words, in one great sweeping flood,
his life came back. No more numbness,
no more indifference; but, in that one
instant, every drop of blood in his veins
seemed charged with electric power, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the morning air was like nectar. He stood
there, strong, like a man; and then there
was one report, and he fell dead,—dead
in the dust of the Virginia soil.</p>

<p>This is the one picture that has been

regions of Nevada and the undulating
lawns and woody slopes of California. In
the snow-clad forests of the Sierra Nevada,
and even in the tropical glory of sky
and air in Arizona, amid the noise and
bustle of the camp, with heavenly peace
and loveliness above, and murderous
savages, thirsting for our blood lying in
deadly ambush all around, I still have
seen this picture. A dead man lying with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
his face to the earth; while close by his
side one little spot of dust seems blackened
and congealed by blood.</p>

<p>And afterwards? The sunshine steals
softly and furtively through the darkened
windows of a happy Northern home. It
is June, and the perfume of the roses is
on the air. In an easy-chair half sits, half
reclines, a pale girl, with a happy face,
looking down with a perfect smile at Tom,
who sits at her feet. And near by stands
a nurse, holding in her arms a baby,—a
baby whose two gelatinous arms beat the
air wildly, while his voice is raised in a
shrill note, which may be triumph or which
may be agony.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” Tom says admiringly, “his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
high notes are stunning; ar’n’t they,
Nettie?”</p>

<p>“Tom,” replies Nettie, threateningly,
“dare to make fun of your offspring again,
and we will leave you, and start for Indiana.
Won’t we, Baby?”</p>

<p>To this question, reply is given by an
absurd inclination of the head on one
side and another wheezy shriek.</p>

<p>“I am not laughing, I am not laughing,”
Tom hastens to remark, lest the threat of
Indiana should be repeated; “so don’t get
angry, Baby. I say, Nettie, we must have
a name for him. We can’t call him Baby
all the time, you know.”</p>

<p>“He was named long ago, Tom,” said
Nettie, “though of course I had to wait.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
We must call him ‘Ned;’ we couldn’t call
him by any other name.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, darling,” said Tom,
gravely; “that is the way you make me
love you more and more every day.” And
he kisses his wife, and, rising, takes the
baby and looks on its face, while his eyes
are filled with tears.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And afterwards? The Professor’s room
at Harvard is still as it was when we first
knew it, with the photograph still hanging
over the mantel-piece. And the Professor
sits there gazing at it more lonely
now than ever before. He is growing
quite old; he is very sarcastic and astonishing;
and dreadful stories are current<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
among the students in regard to his
severity against culprits in the meetings
of the Faculty. There are two or three
who know him, and to whom he is very
kind. They heard him tell the story of
his boys, and they heard poor Ned’s last
letter. But the Professor declared then
that he should never speak of the subject
again; and the few who heard him saw
that the rest of his life must be sad. And
now, as he takes up the notes and emendations
of his old lecture on “Domestic
Arts,” whose turn has come again, his eye
falls on the picture. Again it is the
spring weather, again the fresh breeze
enters his room. He rises and walks to
the window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wonder if he is near,” he says, half
aloud. “‘It was in such a season and at
such a time, that I last saw the dear old
place; and, if ever I can be on earth again,
it is there that I should wish to be.’ Poor
Ned! Poor Ned!”</p>

<p>And, as he sits in his chair again, the
picture fades from my view, and I see only
the moonlight on our mountain camp, and
hear the wailing of the western wind.</p>

<p>And afterwards? Once more the
country is intact, freed from the deadly
perils which assailed her. We know now
what the words “our country” mean,—rocks
which the Atlantic lashes with its
spray; broad uplands and vast prairies
where almost spontaneously fruit and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
grain seem to spring forth from the rich
soil; and barren hills as well, with only
the sage-brush for vegetation, within whose
secret treasure-houses lie great masses of
gold and silver ore. From the summits
of the Sierra Nevada you can stand at
midsummer in a forest where wreaths of
snow lie on the trees, and can gaze far
down into valleys, thousands of feet beneath,
where there are rippling streamlets,
and masses of flowers of the most brilliant
and the most delicate hues. This wonderful
country, that is still in its infancy, that
is nursing men of every nation to form a
new nation; this country, that, with all its
imperfections, stands now on the grand
basis of universal freedom,—justifies not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
merely enthusiasm, but any loss of human
life which may aid in its preservation.
These friends, these brothers, knew what
was the true meaning of life, and with
that knowledge, gained by zeal and study,
offered their lives as a sacrifice. Woe to
our country should the great debt owed
to these heroes be ever forgotten!</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
